<p> <b>The FIRST Lightning Camp is 28th March 2026 </b>
</div>

<p><B>Hosted by <a href="https://compilepython.com/">compilepython.com</a></B></p>
<p>Two of the best bits of a Python conference, <b>ONLINE NEAR YOU (UK / Europe / Africa)</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightning talks to spark ideas</li>
<li>Open space sessions shaped by those attending - like you!</li>
</ul>
<p>We kick off with lightning talks. If you've got a project to share,
that's a great reason to attend - there's space for you. Propose a
lightning talk in advance, or on the day.</p>
<p>Then we move into open space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three parallel tracks</li>
<li>A shared board for pitching sessions</li>
<li>You propose it, you run it</li>
<li>The law of two clicks - if a session isn't for you, quietly move to
one that is</li>
</ul>
<p>One track is hosted by <a href="https://compilepython.com/">compilepython.com</a> and focused on compiling
Python, performance, portability, sustainability, and real-world
experience.</p>
<p>The other two tracks are community space. What are you curious about?
What do you want to explore? What do you want to build?</p>
<p>This isn't a polished speaker line-up. It's a structured, energetic
day of people comparing notes.</p>
<p><strong>We ask one thing: each session nominates a scribe.</strong></p>

<h2 id="coc"> Be Kind, Play Nice, Don't Make others Uncomfortable </h2>

<P> We have a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/training/research-software-camps/code-of-conduct">code of conduct inherited from the SSI</a>, please read it. The above is a short summary of the spirit.

<hr />
<h2 id="whats-the-compilepython.com-track"><strong>What's the <a href="https://compilepython.com/">compilepython.com</a> track?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://compilepython.com/">compilepython.com</a> is a community effort to build a guide to Python
compiler tools (think "like TripAdvisor"). It aims to capture and share
real-world experience: performance wins, green compute gains, and the
occasional battle scar along the way.</p>
<p><b>This Lightning Camp kicks the <a href="https://compilepython.com/">compilepython.com</a> project off
properly.</b></p>
<p>Not sure what to bring? Start here:</p>
<p>Have you tried tools like ShedSkin, Nuitka, Cython, PyPy, Pythran,
Codon, Mojo, mypyc or similar? We want the real-world wins, the
trade-offs, the war stories, and the bits that didn't quite behave.</p>
<p>That's what the compilepython track is for.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-about-other-time-zones"><strong>What about other time
zones?</strong></h3>
<p>People are building Python compilers and similar tools around the
world. We'd love to share the space. If you're willing to steer an event
in Australasia (AEDT) or the Americas timezones (US MT), please get in
contact!</p>
<p>The ambition: on 28 March, at 10am local time - Australasia,
Europe/Africa, the Americas - a Lightning Camp kicks off near you,
following the sun.</p>
<p>Ambitious? Perhaps. But why not.</p>
<p>⚠️ Australia and US editions depend on volunteer co-hosts. This
listing is for the UK / Europe session.</p>
