# compilepython.github.io

This is the publishing end point for <https://compilepython.com/>

The site is managed, discussed and updated here:

* <https://github.com/sparkslabs/compilepython>

Contibutions are very welcome there.

The sync process between the two is not automated.  It may be at some point
but not at this instant, the lack of automation is a feature, not a bug - since
it allows a check before publication.
